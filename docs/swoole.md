            'max_request' => 1000,           // Max requests per worker before recycling
            'max_conn' => 10000,             // Maximum connections
            'socket_buffer_size' => 8 * 1024 * 1024, // Socket buffer size
            'buffer_output_size' => 32 * 1024 * 1024, // Output buffer size
            'package_max_length' => 10 * 1024 * 1024, // Max package size
        ],
    ],
];
```

```php
// Example of WebSocket handler with Swoole in Laravel
use Swoole\WebSocket\Server;
use Swoole\Http\Request;
use Swoole\WebSocket\Frame;

// In a service provider or command
$server = app()->make(Server::class);

$server->on('open', function (Server $server, Request $request) {
    echo "Connection open: {$request->fd}\n";
    // Store connection in Redis for broadcasting
    Redis::sadd('online_users', $request->fd);
});

$server->on('message', function (Server $server, Frame $frame) {
    $message = json_decode($frame->data);
    
    // Process message
    $processedMessage = process_message($message);
    
    // Broadcast to all connections
    foreach (Redis::smembers('online_users') as $fd) {
        if ($server->isEstablished($fd)) {
            $server->push($fd, json_encode($processedMessage));
        }
    }
});

$server->on('close', function (Server $server, int $fd) {
    echo "Connection close: {$fd}\n";
    Redis::srem('online_users', $fd);
});
```

### API-Heavy Services
For services primarily serving API requests, Swoole offers significant advantages:

- **Microservices**: High-performance microservice endpoints.
- **API Gateways**: Efficient API gateway implementations.
- **Data Processing APIs**: Fast processing of data-intensive API requests.
- **Mobile App Backends**: Responsive backends for mobile applications.

```php
// Example of optimizing API routes for Swoole
// routes/api.php

// Pre-resolve frequently used services in Octane
use App\Services\UserService;
use App\Services\AuthService;

// These services will be resolved once and reused
$userService = app(UserService::class);
$authService = app(AuthService::class);

Route::middleware('api')->group(function () use ($userService, $authService) {
    Route::get('/users', function () use ($userService) {
        return $userService->getAllUsers();
    });
    
    Route::post('/auth/login', function (Request $request) use ($authService) {
        return $authService->login($request->only(['email', 'password']));
    });
});
```

### Computing-Intensive Applications
Swoole's task workers are ideal for CPU-bound operations:

- **Image/Video Processing**: Offload media processing to task workers.
- **Report Generation**: Generate complex reports without blocking web workers.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform data analysis tasks in the background.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle batch operations efficiently.

```php
// Example of using Swoole task workers for image processing
use Swoole\Server;

// In your controller
public function processImage(Request $request)
{
    $image = $request->file('image');
    $userId = $request->user()->id;
    
    // Store original image
    $path = $image->store('originals');
    
    // Queue image processing in Swoole task worker
    $server = app()->make(Server::class);
    $server->task([
        'type' => 'image_processing',
        'path' => $path,
        'user_id' => $userId,
        'options' => [
            'resize' => true,
            'width' => 800,
            'height' => 600,
            'optimize' => true,
        ]
    ]);
    
    return response()->json(['status' => 'processing', 'path' => $path]);
}

// In your Swoole task handler
$server->on('task', function (Server $server, $task_id, $worker_id, $data) {
    if ($data['type'] === 'image_processing') {
        $processor = new ImageProcessor();
        $result = $processor->process(
            $data['path'],
            $data['options']
        );
        
        // Notify user or update database with result
        DB::table('processed_images')->insert([
            'user_id' => $data['user_id'],
            'original_path' => $data['path'],
            'processed_path' => $result['path'],
            'created_at' => now(),
        ]);
    }
    
    return true;
});
```

// WebSocket handler
Octane::webSocketHandler(function ($request, $websocket) {
    // Authenticate the WebSocket connection
    if (!Auth::check()) {
        return $websocket->close();
    }
    
    // Join user to appropriate channels
    $user = Auth::user();
    $websocket->join("user.{$user->id}");
    
    foreach ($user->teams as $team) {
        $websocket->join("team.{$team->id}");
    }
    
    return $websocket;
});

// WebSocket message handler
Octane::webSocketMessage(function ($message, $websocket) {
    $payload = json_decode($message, true);
    
    switch ($payload['type']) {
        case 'chat':
            // Broadcast chat message to team
            $websocket->to("team.{$payload['team_id']}")
                ->broadcast(json_encode([
                    'type' => 'chat',
                    'user' => Auth::user()->only(['id', 'name']),
                    'message' => $payload['message'],
                    'timestamp' => now()->toIso8601String(),
                ]));
            break;
            
        case 'typing':
            // Broadcast typing indicator
            $websocket->to("team.{$payload['team_id']}")
                ->broadcast(json_encode([
                    'type' => 'typing',
                    'user' => Auth::user()->only(['id', 'name']),
                ]));
            break;
    }
});
```

## Limitations and Considerations

### Extension Requirement
- **PHP Extension Installation**: Requires compilation and installation of the Swoole extension.
- **Server Requirements**: May require root access or special permissions to install.
- **Compatibility**: Not all hosting providers support custom PHP extensions.
- **Maintenance**: Need to update the extension when PHP versions change.

### Singleton/Static Issues
- **Global State**: Persistent PHP runtime means global/static variables persist between requests.
- **Memory Leaks**: Potential for memory leaks in long-running processes.
- **Service Container**: Need to be careful with Laravel's service container bindings.
- **Request Isolation**: Must ensure proper request isolation to prevent data leakage.

```php
// Example of potential issues with static variables
class UserCounter
{
    public static $count = 0;
    
    public static function increment()
    {
        self::$count++;
    }
}

// In a controller
public function showDashboard()
{
    UserCounter::increment();
    return view('dashboard', ['count' => UserCounter::$count]);
}

// This will keep incrementing across all requests in Swoole!
// Need to reset in a middleware or use instance properties instead
```

### Compatibility Challenges
- **Third-Party Packages**: Some Laravel packages may not be compatible with Swoole.
- **File Uploads**: Different handling of file uploads compared to traditional PHP.
- **Output Buffering**: Different behavior with output buffering functions.
- **Extension Conflicts**: Potential conflicts with other PHP extensions.

### Memory Management
- **Memory Leaks**: Long-running processes require careful memory management.
- **Worker Recycling**: Need to configure worker recycling to prevent memory issues.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Must ensure proper cleanup of resources after each request.
- **Monitoring**: Requires monitoring of memory usage in production.
